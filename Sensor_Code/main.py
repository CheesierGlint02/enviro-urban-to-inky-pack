# enviro - wireless environmental monitoring and logging
#
# on first run enviro will go into provisioning mode where it appears
# as a wireless access point called "Enviro <board type> Setup". connect
# to the access point with your phone, tablet or laptop and follow the
# on screen instructions.
#
# the provisioning process will generate a `config.py` file which 
# contains settings like your wifi username/password, how often you
# want to log data, and where to upload your data once it is collected.
#
# you can use enviro out of the box with the options that we supply
# or alternatively you can create your own firmware that behaves how
# you want it to - please share your setups with us! :-)
